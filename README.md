# ContinuousDeliveryExample
#This is a personal repo to demonstrate where my skill set for CI/CD is currently and to track how I am improving.
#Some files have nothing to do with CI/CD, just me goofing around with stuff I am reading about.
#Feel welcomed to offer suggestions on how I can do better or what reading you think would help me. 

#When complete there will be sections for the following

#1) Spinning Up Vagrant Boxes in which to deploy onto.
#2) Using Docker Containers
#3) Using Kubernetes
#4) Building Pipelines in Jenkins

#The languages I use is primarily is Python. Systems I work in are Linux flavors of Ubuntu and Centos.
#I typically deal with Site Reliability and CI/CD pipelines. Full coding is not a strong suite but one that I am constantly working on.
